Git Mindset
Hashing -> function that takes an input if arbitrary size and produces output of fixed size
Hash collision -> when a number of different inputs produce same output
SHA-256 -> a hashing function royalty free with very low odds for collision and fast

Blob -> Binary Large OBject

GitBash
Vim
    name.txt -> create a new file from GitBash
    :wq - save and exit
    :qa - exit without saving  (QuitAll)

cat name.txt => print contents of the file to console | stand for concatenate
diff -u A.txt B.txt => show the differance between two files -u stands for Unified format
diff -u A.txt B.txt > fileName => dump the output of the diff into a file
patch A.txt mychange => patch a file where mychange is a file produced by diff
    (add changes from the difference to file A)

pwd => present working directory
ls -l => list long format -> show contents of a directory with details

touch => change file access and modification times | if a file doesn't exist it is created
files starting with '.' like .hidden are hidden
ls -a shows all files including hidden ones
we can combine flags , instead of ls -l -a we can just write ls -la
ls -alR => R will list recursively
. current directory
.. parent directory

echo => send anything as standard output
echo some text > filename => will set the contents of a file to the output of echo
echo more text >> filename => will append
| is a pipe operator, it takes standard output of a preceding command and passes it as standard input
    to the following command
> operator is a shortcut for '| tee'
i.e echo some text | tee file => pipe operator will take standard output of the echo and pass it as standard input
    to the tee command

tee => utility that copies standard input to standard output, making a copy in zero or more files
find . show directory structure from current directory

rm -rf => rm remove r recursive f force - will not ask for confirmation ! Warning be very careful will rf !

The folder where we set up a project is called 'Project working directory' aka working tree
    inside of it will be created .git directory and that is the repository where all versions are kept

git status
git add <filename>
git commit
git config --global --list show configured user and email
git show
git commit -m "add commit message as part of the command" => no need to go thru text editor
git show "HEAD:readme.txt" show contents of a file
git show "HEAD:" show commit tree
git log => shows all commits from HEAD to master
git help command or git command --help => documentation for any command
